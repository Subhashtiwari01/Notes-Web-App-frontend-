# TakeNote React Component

The TakeNote component is a simple note-taking application built with React. It allows users to add, view, and delete notes. The notes are fetched from and saved to a backend server.

## Features

- **Add Note**: Users can add new notes by entering text into the input field and clicking the "Add Note" button.
- **View Notes**: Existing notes are displayed in a grid layout, each with a delete button to remove the note.
- **Delete Note**: Users can delete a note by clicking the delete button associated with that note.
- **Popup Messages**: Popup messages provide feedback to the user about the status of note operations, such as note addition and deletion.

## Usage

To use the TakeNote component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have React installed in your project.

2. **Import Component**: Import the TakeNote component into your project where you want to use it.

    ```javascript
    import TakeNote from './TakeNote';
    ```

3. **Include Component**: Include the TakeNote component in your JSX markup.

    ```javascript

    ```

## Dependencies

- **React**: This component is built using React hooks for state management and lifecycle methods.
- **FontAwesome**: FontAwesome icons are used for the delete button icon.

## Backend Integration

This component interacts with a backend server to fetch and save notes. Ensure that your backend server exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /allNotes`: Returns all notes stored on the server.
- `POST /addNote`: Adds a new note to the server.
- `DELETE /deleteNotes/:id`: Deletes the note with the specified ID from the server.

Make sure to update the fetch URLs in the component file to match your backend server endpoints.
